Nexus Web Framework
===

Nexus provides a high-level web framework for [Nim](https://nim-lang.org),
with batteries included. The goal is to create a similar framework for Nim as
Django is for Python or Rails is for Ruby. You can create web apps,
web-services and console applications.

See the [documentation](https://jfilby.github.io/nexus) to learn about Nexus,
and how to use it to write web-apps and web-services.
